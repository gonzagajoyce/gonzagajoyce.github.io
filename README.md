## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​I created a simple and personal website to introduce myself. I chose soft colors, rounded elements, and friendly fonts to match my style. There’s a profile photo, a biography where I share my story and why I’m learning to code, and a page showing a small project. You can also find links to my LinkedIn and email.


### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.
I used Flexbox and media queries to make it look good on phones and bigger screens. I also used semantic HTML to keep the structure clear. The project has two pages, is version-controlled with Git, and I published it using GitHub Pages.

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
I added small effects when you hover over links to make the site feel more alive.
​
### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
